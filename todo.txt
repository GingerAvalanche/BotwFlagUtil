TODO:
korok flags based on static.smubin?
IsDefeat flags (hinox/stalnox category 8, molduga category 9, talus category 10)
OreDrop# flags? (figure out what these are, how they are determined to be needed, what they actually do)
flag metadata section (why was the flag made? why are the properties the way they are?)

DONE:
make categories uneditable, use strings instead of integers
make sure categories get saved to output
revival flags based on actor tags (except shrines, RevivalBloodyMoon becomes type 2 instead of 1)
Defeated_[actor_name]_Num flags (use LevelSensor to determine which ones are needed)
quest flags (QuestProduct.sbquestpack)
add filters for flag list
add mod change cache in appdata (write changes when manual, delete changes when automatic, load changes on mod load)

CANCELED:
add buttons to go to next unconfirmed flag - Filters basically render this obsolete
