TODO:
add filter for flag list
add buttons to go to next unconfirmed flag
make categories uneditable, use dropdown with strings instead of integers
korok flags based on static.smubin?
IsDefeat flags (hinox/stalnox category 8, molduga category 9, talus category 10)
OreDrop# flags? (figure out what these are, how they are determined to be needed, what they actually do)

DONE:
make sure categories get saved to output
revival flags based on actor tags (except shrines, RevivalBloodyMoon becomes type 2 instead of 1)
Defeated_[actor_name]_Num flags (use LevelSensor to determine which ones are needed)
quest flags (QuestProduct.sbquestpack)
